# StudySync Development Plan

This development plan outlines the stages required to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of StudySync, focusing on cost-effective solutions.

## Technology Stack & Services

### Frontend 
- Next.js 13+ with TypeScript (Free)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (Free)
- Vercel for hosting (Free tier: includes SSL, CI/CD)

### Backend & Infrastructure 
- Supabase (Free tier includes):
  - PostgreSQL Database with pgvector
  - Authentication 
  - Storage for documents (up to 500MB) 
  - Edge Functions
  - Vector embeddings storage
- OpenAI API (Paid, but cost-effective with GPT-3.5-turbo)

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation Setup  (Completed)
1.  Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2.  Set up Tailwind CSS
3.  Configure Supabase project
4.  Implement basic authentication (sign up/login)
5.  Create basic layout and navigation

### Stage 2: Document Management  (Week 2-3)
1.  Implement document upload functionality
2.  Set up Supabase storage for files
3.  Create document listing and viewing interface
4.  Add basic document organization (folders/tags)
5.  Implement document deletion and management

### Stage 3: Vector Database & Embeddings (Week 4)
1. Enable pgvector extension in Supabase
2. Create vector embedding tables and indexes
3. Implement document processing pipeline:
   - Text extraction from PDFs/documents
   - Chunk text into segments
   - Generate embeddings using OpenAI
   - Store embeddings in Supabase vector columns
4. Create background jobs for document processing

### Stage 4: AI Chat Implementation (Week 5)
1. Implement chat interface
2. Set up RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
   - Query embedding generation
   - Relevant chunk retrieval using Supabase vector similarity search
   - Context assembly
3. Integrate with OpenAI API
4. Implement chat history storage
5. Add basic error handling and rate limiting

### Stage 5: Study Features MVP (Week 6)
1. Implement smart study guide generation
2. Add contextual question answering
3. Create basic quiz generation
4. Implement document insights feature
5. Add simple progress tracking

### Stage 6: Testing & Optimization (Week 7)
1. Implement error handling and logging
2. Add loading states and error messages
3. Optimize document processing
4. Implement basic analytics
5. Performance testing and optimization

### Stage 7: Launch Preparation (Week 8)
1. Security review
2. Add usage limits and monitoring
3. Implement feedback system
4. Create user onboarding flow
5. Deploy to production

## Cost Management Strategies

### Document Storage 
-  Implement file size limits (5MB per file)
-  Use efficient chunking strategies to minimize vector storage
-  Implement cleanup for unused vectors

### API Usage
- Cache common queries and responses
- Implement rate limiting
- Use shorter context windows when possible
- Batch process embeddings

### Infrastructure
- Use serverless functions to minimize costs
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Use edge functions for better performance and cost

## Future Optimization Opportunities
1. Implement local models for certain tasks
2. Add compression for document storage
3. Introduce batch processing for large documents
4. Optimize embedding storage and retrieval
5. Add caching layers for frequently accessed content

## Current Focus
- Complete document organization features
- Prepare for vector database implementation
- Plan AI chat integration

## Timeline Adjustment
- Original Start: January 17, 2024
- Current Phase: Document Management (Stage 2)
- Expected Completion: March 6, 2024 (8 weeks from start)

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with document management features
- Document processing speed and reliability
- AI chat response accuracy and relevance
- System performance and resource usage
